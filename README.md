The odapt library is a bridge between columnar file formats **ROOT, Parquet, Feather, and HDF5.** It aims to simplify file conversions in Python, replacing what is usually a multi-step process with one line of code, with builtin features for managing large datasets and choosing compression levels.

# Getting started

```python
import odapt as od

od.operations.hadd("destination.root",
["file1.root", "file2.root"])
```
